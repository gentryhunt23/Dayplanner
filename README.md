This web application is a virtual daily planner for the typical 9a to 5p business hours. The timeblocks all have inputs that can then be taken and stored in local storage. i have not found a way to create dynamic id's for the timeblocks in local storage just yet but i have found a way to set the local storage in general. Also the time blocks are supposed to change colors based on the current time of day when compared to the time of the event planned (Past, Presemt, Future).
Still perfecting this assignment but submitting what i have finished.
